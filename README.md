# JWT-Cracker
A Python-based tool that attempts to crack a jet ticket password using brute-force techniques and the rockyou.txt wordlist. This script automates the process of password guessing, iterating through each entry in the commonly used rockyou.txt file to find potential matches. It's intended for educational purposes to demonstrate password cracking.
